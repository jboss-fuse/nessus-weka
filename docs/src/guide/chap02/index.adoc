## Data Input/Output

When you get started, it is quite likely that your data isn't available (yet) in a format that data mining libraries can use effectively. 
Lets asume, you have some https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/nessus-weka/master/part01/data/sfny.csv[csv data,window=_blank] that
you first want to convert into Weka's native https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html[.arff,window=_blank] format.

Here is the list of file formats that Weka supports for reading and writing ...

The data that we'll be using here, is borrowed from R2D3's excellent http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/[visual introduction to machine learning,window=_blank]. We have just short of 500 instances of real estate homes with various attributes assigned to them.

Reading data is easy ...

[source,java]
----
Dataset dataset = Dataset.create("data/sfny.csv")
----
    
Converting this into an .arff file is easy too ...

[source,java]
----
dataset.write("data/sfny.arff")
----
    
In fact, because {java-api}/io/nessus/weka/Dataset.java[Dataset,window=_blank] has a functional flow API, we could have done

[source,java]
----
Dataset.create("data/sfny.csv").write("data/sfny.arff")
----

Lets open the {data-part01}/sfny-numeric.arff[converted file,window=_blank] in the Weka Explorer

If this is the first time you see a dataset in Weka, I'll quickly talk you through what we can learn from this view.

* We have 492 data instances with 8 attributes each
* All attributes are of type numeric
* Attribute `in_sf` has two distinct values: 0, 1

We can assume that this attribute is the so called "instance class". 
An attribute value of '1' means a home is in San Francisco, '0' means a home in New York.

### Preparing for Classification

What we have here, is a very simple form of binary classification (i.e. the home is either in San Francisco or it is not). 
The data does not say that yet however. Instead, it only knows about 8 attributes, each of which are numeric.

What we want to do next, is to convert the `in_sf` attribute into a nominal value. The respective nominal values could be "ny" and "sf", 
but we leave it as "0" and "1" for now.

Weka can apply filters to transform a dataset into another more suitable form. 

What we want here, is to apply the `NumericToNominal` attribute filter like this ...

[source,java]
----
// Convert the 'in_sf' attribute to nominal
dataset.apply("NumericToNominal -R first")
----
 
and to reorder the attributes such that `in_sf` becomes the last attribute in the list, like this ... 
 
[source,java]
----
// Move the 'in_sf' attribute to the end
dataset.apply("Reorder -R 2-last,1")
----

We could have left the class attribute in the first position and set this explicitly to be the class attribute. 
Instead, we moved it to the last position where Weka expects to see the class attribute by default. 

Putting it all together in Nessus API, it looks like this ...

[source,java]
----
Dataset.create("data/sfny.csv")
        
    // Convert the 'in_sf' attribute to nominal
    .apply("NumericToNominal -R first")
    
    // Move the 'in_sf' attribute to the end
    .apply("Reorder -R 2-last,1")
    
    // Reset the relation name
    .apply("RenameRelation -modify sfny")

    // Write out the resulting dataset
    .write("data/sfny.arff");
----

If you haven't done already, lets now open the {data-part01}/sfny.arff[resulting dataset,window=_blank] in the Weka Explorer

If you click on the "Visualize All" button, you'll see ...

Which one of those attributes is a good candidate for initial class discrimination? Have a guess ...
